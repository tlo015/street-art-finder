TEAM TYPE NERDY TO ME: PROJECT 1: STREET ART FINDER
https://tlo015.github.io/street-art-finder/
 
GOAL:
Who is the user: artists, photographers, influencers and bloggers
What: Building a web-based site that allows its users to easily track the location of existing and relevant street art.
How: Using a flicker API or equivalent to display top x amount of street art, access the geo-location of the picture to display on Google maps a toggle icon that, on click, will display more information on the piece of art like its specific location and comments.
Use a form to allow users to add comments such as: how accurate the map is, whether the art work still exists and whether it has been vandalised.
Scope: use 3-5 known artist
 
Technologies used:
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
Javascript including JQuery
Firebase to store data
Github
 
Project Group Members:
Celso Oliveira – backend for Flicker API
Eric Liu – overall backend – Firebase and JQuery
Rafael Fraga – backend for Google Apis
Regina Lo - html
Handler:

Minimal Viable Product:
User front-end interface designed in HTML using CSS and Bootstrap which will allow the user to make searches via destination (zip code). The page will predominantly be a Google Maps interface with multiple small pins. Once pins are opened (moduler), it will allow users to use a form to comment on things such as location accuracy, safety rating and comments
Firebase will be used to store the user input forms/ratings that will interact with the front-end elements.
Parameters will be pulled from Flicker API and tested in Google Cloud Vision API for relevancy. If relevant, it will be displayed on Google Maps as a pin or image (?).
